CS171,Introduction to Computer Science II,Fall,2021,Ace value,10/1/2021 19:01,When exactly do we make the ace a 1 v.s. an 11? Is the rule always to make it an 11 unless it would bust the hand?

How do I know that a move is legal?,hw3,qBhsb9AT1D,Noelle,Herman,,,10/14/2021 17:11,Take advantage of what the method move() returns. It is true in certain situations and false in others. You can then push depending on the value.,YXCMIivcy6,Eli,Pontecorvo,10/15/2021 5:19,The move method checks if a move is legal for you. You should use this method to change the behavior of your code based on whether or not it returns true or false.,RwKSObZt8b,Elizabeth,Park,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
